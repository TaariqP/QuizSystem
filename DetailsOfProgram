Hello there!
(I didn't call this a ReadMe because nobody seems to read ReadMe files anymore)
Welcome to the Ultimate Quiz System. Brief notes before you continue.
MainApplication is the root of this application. 
I have kept the components of various parts of the program in the package as part of future development.
Some parts are completely unneccessary and irrelevant such as "lottery.java".
Formatting might be slightly different due to use of different compilers.
Generally code style follows the Google Java Code styling which can be found online.

Not an Open Source project just yet but watch this space!
